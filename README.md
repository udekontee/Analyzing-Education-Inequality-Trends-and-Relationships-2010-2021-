# Analyzing Education Inequality Trends and Relationships (2010–2021)

## 1. Introduction
Education inequality is a pressing issue that affects access to opportunities, societal development, and global progress. This analysis focuses on understanding trends, distributions, and relationships in education inequality over time, across different regions, and among specific countries.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this analysis comprises **Education Inequality Indicators** from 2010 to 2021. It includes metrics such as:
- Education inequality percentages over the years.
- Regional and country-level data.
- Human Development Index (HDI) rankings for the year 2021.

### Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to gain actionable insights into education inequality by addressing the following:
- **Trends**: Analyze how education inequality has changed over the years globally.
- **Distributions**: Examine the spread and frequency of education inequality levels in 2021.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Highlight differences in education inequality across various regions.
- **Relationships**: Explore the correlation between HDI ranks and education inequality to understand socioeconomic impacts.
- **Country-Specific Trends**: Focus on specific countries like Afghanistan, Angola, and Albania to understand localized patterns.

By using data visualization and statistical insights, this project aims to shed light on key factors influencing education inequality and provide a foundation for further research or policy formulation.

## 2. Key Insights from Visualizations

### 1. Average Education Inequality (2010–2021)

##### Fig. 1 Source: The World Bank Group - The line chart demonstrates the steady decline in average education inequality globally over the years from 2010 to 2021. Starting at a value above 20.5 in 2010, education inequality has consistently decreased, reaching approximately 18 by 2021. This trend highlights progress in reducing disparities in education access worldwide, indicating the positive impact of global efforts, policies, and investments to achieve education equity. The declining trend suggests a shift towards more inclusive and equitable education systems over the decade analyzed. 

### 2. Distribution of Education Inequality (2021)
- The histogram highlights a **concentration of countries** with lower levels of education inequality in 2021.

 #### Fig 2 WorldBank Group - The histogram illustrates the distribution of education inequality levels across countries in 2021. The majority of countries exhibit low levels of education inequality, with most values concentrated between 0 and 20. This suggests that a significant portion of countries have made strides toward equitable access to education. However, the chart also reveals a smaller number of countries with higher levels of inequality, with values ranging from 30 to 50. These outliers highlight persistent challenges in achieving education equity in certain regions or contexts.

### 3. Education Inequality by Region (2021)
- The bar chart reveals significant **regional differences** in education inequality.

 ##### Fig3. Source: The WorldBank Group - This bar chart illustrates the average education inequality across different regions in 2021. Regions such as <strong>South Asia (SA)</strong> and <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)</strong> show the highest levels of education inequality, highlighting significant challenges in providing equitable access to education. On the other hand, regions like <strong>Europe and Central Asia (ECA)</strong> have the lowest levels of education inequality, reflecting the success of policies and systems that promote inclusivity in education. The stark disparity between these regions emphasizes the need for targeted, region-specific strategies to address education inequality and improve access in underperforming areas. 

### 4. HDI Rank vs. Education Inequality (2021)
- The scatter plot illustrates a **clear relationship** between HDI rank and education inequality:

#### Fig4. **Source: The WorldBank Group** - The scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between HDI rank and education inequality in 2021. Countries with higher HDI ranks tend to have lower levels of education inequality, suggesting that better human development outcomes are associated with more equitable access to education. In contrast, countries with lower HDI ranks often face higher education inequality, reflecting the interconnected nature of development challenges. This pattern highlights the critical role of addressing socioeconomic inequalities to achieve education equity, reinforcing the importance of integrating education reforms with broader development strategies. 

### 5. Education Inequality Trends for Selected Countries
- The line chart comparing Afghanistan, Angola, and Albania highlights **country-specific trends**:

#### Fig5. Source: The WorldBank Group - This line chart compares education inequality trends for Afghanistan, Angola, and Albania from 2010 to 2021. Afghanistan has consistently maintained high levels of education inequality throughout the decade, showcasing persistent challenges in achieving equity in education. Angola experienced a sharp increase in inequality around 2014, stabilizing at higher levels thereafter, suggesting possible systemic or policy shifts during that period. Albania, in contrast, consistently demonstrates low levels of education inequality, reflecting robust education policies and successful measures to ensure equitable access to education. These country-specific trends underline the varying levels of success and challenges in tackling education inequality globally. 

## 3. Methodology

The analysis of education inequality from 2010 to 2021 involved several key steps to ensure data quality and effective visualization. Below is a brief description of the process:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- The dataset contained missing values in key columns, such as **Education Inequality**, **HDI Rank (2021)**, and **UNDP Developing Regions**.
- Missing values for numerical columns were handled by imputing the **mean value** of the respective columns.
- Categorical missing values (e.g., regions) were filled or labeled as "Unknown" where appropriate.

### 2. Handling Missing Values
- Missing values in year-by-year **Education Inequality columns (2010–2021)** were systematically filled using Python.
- Outliers were analyzed and removed using statistical techniques such as the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method, ensuring data integrity for accurate insights.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Pandas**, we created visualizations to:
  - Explore trends in education inequality over the years.
  - Compare distributions and relationships between education inequality and HDI rankings.
  - Analyze regional differences and country-specific trends.

Following these steps ensured the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis, providing meaningful insights into global education inequality.

## 4. Conclusion

The analysis of education inequality from 2010 to 2021 reveals several important trends and insights:

- **Steady Progress**: Globally, there has been a steady decline in education inequality over the years, indicating progress in equitable access to education.
- **Regional Variations**: Regions such as South Asia (SA) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continue to experience higher education inequality compared to regions like Europe and Central Asia (ECA), emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in underperforming regions.
- **Relationship with HDI**: Countries with higher HDI rankings generally exhibit lower education inequality, highlighting the interconnectedness of socioeconomic development and education equity.
- **Country-Specific Insights**: Afghanistan shows consistently high education inequality, while Angola experienced a sharp increase around 2014, and Albania maintains low inequality levels, reflecting differences in policies and socioeconomic conditions.

### Possible Implications
These findings underscore the need for:
- Continued investment in education policies, particularly in regions with higher inequality.
- Integrated approaches that address socioeconomic factors alongside education access.
- Monitoring and evaluation to ensure sustainable progress toward education equity.
- By understanding these patterns, policymakers, researchers, and organizations can better allocate resources and implement strategies to address education inequality globally.
